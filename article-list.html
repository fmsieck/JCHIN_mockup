                This picture was taken at some point during the month of December 2013; before a logistics company moved in to their location near the canal downtown. 
                They commissioned this to be a center-piece for their company. The area where this was painted would eventually become the reception area. 
                As you can see, there's still a lot of construction going on but I was able to get my friend in after hours so he could take a few
                pictures. At the time of this picture, the piece was not yet completed.  In total it took about three days to complete and measures approximately
                15ft x 25ft.
